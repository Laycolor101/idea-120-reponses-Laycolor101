# *Contemporary Tools*

## By Jamaica Spencer

In Chris Salters “Entangled” he discusses the Gesamtkunstwerk, is the idea of bringing all forms of art together and presenting them in a theatrical sense, which was the contemporary tool during that period. Gesamtkunstwerk is supposed to get rid of each art forms individual meaning or significance and fuse them together. The concept is to create an alternate realm in the art world, one that focuses on the audience’s sense and emotions through media elements. Intellect, Social and politically issues have no place in a world like this because it doesn’t contribute to the audience.
