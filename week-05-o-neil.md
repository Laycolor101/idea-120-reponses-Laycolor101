# Weapon of Math Destruction

## By Jamaica Spencer

One example of this process is that O’Neil describes is the newsmagazine “U.S News & World Report” took on a project over evaluating 1,800 colleges and universities in the United States and ranked them based on excellence. At first the ranking was dependent on opinion surveys sent to the university presidents which brought in complaints because it wasn’t based on statistics and models. A new method came up to determine a school excellence based on SAT scores, student-teacher ratios and acceptance rates a WMD that produced an algorithm and became the new national standard. Can this new system of measurement do bad or good? As an effort to move up on the ranking list a Baylor University paid for its students to retake the SAT. Bucknell University and California’s Claremont Mckenna sent in false data for new students to move up on the list as well. Most college administration went about improving their rank the right way allowing them to receive more money, smarter students, and professors. A system that pushed colleges and universities to make positive improvements to their schools, however it came to define the measure the equality of these colleges. A rigged and difficult system to move up on because they aren’t graded on their own and how much improve is made doesn’t mean much unless it done in a fast pace compared to the other schools are competing against. It’s a game of keeping up and being faster than everybody in their improvements to move up on the list. TCU decided to up their game and launch a 250-million-dollar fundraiser and passed their goal raising 434 million. This boosted their ranking and spending of 100 million on campus improvements such as a sports training center, which their team Horned frogs winning the Rose Bowl undefeated. Factors that attracted new students, more selective, raising test scores and more rejections meaning lower acceptance rates. All factors that played into the ranking requirements. The US News Model did push schools to improve but they all pushed towards the same things and outcomes which can have a negative effect on students who can’t afford to attend the colleges and/or don’t have the required scores. Target schools can manipulate the system as to reject top students who send in applications to improve their selectivity rating; however, the education rating is low because of those top students not attending requiring the universities to offer more money to entice a select few to attend. A productive yet flawed system not only because it can be rigid to give universities the rating, they want but also because it measures the top universities such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Stanford and what makes them excellent, a measurement that other universities then must compete with try to meet those. No longer about education but about moving up on the ranking list through selectivity, scoring, activities and their fight to attract the top students who can afford to attend and have high scores. Equality among school quality but not among students as those who can’t afford to attend and not the best scores are not attended to and left out because they can’t offer to that “important" ranking.
