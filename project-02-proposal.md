# Proposal

## By Jamaica Spencer


For my green screen project I wanted it to be angled as a first
person perspective. The viewer is one of many worker ants inside the colony.
Your in charge of completing various task such as defending the nest, taking out trash, forging food and feeding larva.
Your just a typical ant carrying out your day to day task inside the ant hill.
