# Dawn of Internet Tv

## By Jamaica Spencer

I believe Murray's predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual environments were successful because its active in a lot of technology we have today.
When he says “Internet is beginning to function as an alternate broadcasting system” he is correct because becoming the main source of what people use for viewing shows,
movies, films, hidden content, and extra footage. Internet tv has transitioned to a place where its included in gaming systems, mobile devices, and smart TVs. This also
known as “The merger that Nicholas Negroponte has long been predicting is upon us: the computer, television, and telephone are becoming a single home appliance.” These
devices are transforming into tools we use for entertainment, gaming, and control systems. Millennials and other generations who are discovering these apps don’t really
spend to much time watching television (cable tv) unless it has the internet so that they watch things like Netflix, Hulu showtime etc. which is also available on consoles,
phones, and computers. Which is a n example of Murrays “Putting broadcast television into digital form would also allow products to make previously aired episodes available on
demand.” These are platforms where we go to not only see new shows but views full seasons of previous that are no longer on air. A transition from one technology to the next
to appeal to a larger audience. This soon transitioned into the virtual realm where users can participate in these shows/films/movies and feel like they’re there. The viewer is now the participant. As Murray said, “Increasing levels of participatory viewership are preparing us for a near-future medium which we will be 
able to point and click through different branches of a single tv program.” Internet Tv is transitioning into virtual reality and the consoles used for it. Such as the Oculus
where the user can watch Netflix and navigate through the program with the handheld device and controls, the viewer is then made to feel as if they are a character in what
they’re watching. This relates to the hyper-realistic virtual environments the actors of 'The Mandalorian' inhabit because the setting is produced by LED screen projecting
to create a virtual reality on the tv screen. Its turn green screening into a new internet tv device which is aired on consoles using internet access. Actors/Actresses are
in a physical reality roleplaying as characters They must pretend and make this setting/scene realistic for the audience through body movement, gestures, facial expressions,
and language. It there job not only to play their role but convince the audience and take them to this fictional world. Makes the audience feel as if they’re there.
The viewers are transformed into a hyper-reality they are to be convinced that this fictional is “real” and that their experiencing this journey with the actors. Simply a
bystander or sometimes an active participant in this realm. The film/show/movie seems so surreal that the person feels as though they have been invited into this place and
 their surrounding area outside the device their using is gone or has faded away.
