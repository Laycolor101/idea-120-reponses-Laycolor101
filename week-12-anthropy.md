Accessibility can help improve video games because everybody would be able to have an input in the type of games they like to play and share it with others. Community, learning new skills, and creativity.

This would allow gamers to build an even bigger community outside of just conversating about gaming such as strategies, characters and other details about the game. People would be building a place where they can create video games together. Teaching each other coding techniques, teamwork and a way into the marketing world. The community could more than about talking but people starting their own businesses together, marketing and managing, factors that also play into share your own work for profit or just simply building games with your friends for fun.


People usually have fun more fun learning new things when it involves something that they enjoy. Using videogames to teach people coding is one of those activities. You can gain more peoples attention, open up others to learning. There's more way to learn things and once people see opportunities to learn they way they want and see that other people are involved they'll be more interested and comfortable in participating.


People would be able to express their own creative sides through coding. Building their own videogames based on their imaginations and things that they value instead of being compressed into a boxed world bases on someone else ideas. The person or people would have full control over aspects such as character design, settings, storylines, etc.
