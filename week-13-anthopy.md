Why has character customization remained an important part of gameplay in American role-playing games and phase out in Japanese?

I think a person must first understand why character customization is important. Character creation allows players to create a figure that resembles who believe themselves to be and results in the player becoming more invested in the game along with an emotional connection. Players already become connected to this character and don’t have to try and build one through gameplay. Players can have authority over their experience and provokes motivation.

I don’t believe it’s based on the idea that “American culture sells individuality and ego” it makes it seems like it’s something that doesn’t exist and something that’s created for us to be fixed on bring meaning to our own lives. Individuality is a major part of American culture, it’s a melting pot. There are people of all cultures and ethnicities that live here and desire to have representation of themselves in the things they see. It is important especially when most to the movies, games, and advertisements you see tend to be fixed to show only two type of people. Not based on entitlement but based on the fact we live in a world where individuality is apart of a person’s character and what makes you stand out.

Now Japanese role-playing games aren’t fixed on character creation because it isn’t as diverse as American. What would really be the point of adding something like that to their gameplay when the people who are playing it are already designed into the game. No-one would feel the need to make themselves because its already representation of them.
