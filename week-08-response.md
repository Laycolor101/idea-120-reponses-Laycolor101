There’s a few methods and scenarios in the passage that I have been subject to. One would be the computer virus ad. It’s like these group of hackers that send some type of ad to your computer when your on the internet claiming the computer has a virus and you can’t do anything else but stayed fixed on that pop up. There’s a number on screen they want you to call to get the problem solved. I’ve don’t it once but soon realized it was a scam when they want you to pay money for software to remove. I solved it myself by just shutting my computer down and turning it back on the problem is gone. In the passage their known as predatory ads which I’ve seen on YouTube have scammed lots of people. Another one is that I’ve been subject to colleges looking for students through the various us of TV ads, billboards, bus stops, mail, recruiters and other advertising. They aren’t always a bad thing, as for myself they contributed to me attending UIC and I’ve researched about it myself. One that’s common for me is the constant sending of credit cards offers to my house, but I didn’t know that it was part of a test. I always wonder how they people get my information when I never signed up to receive one and I don’t have one either. I just always throw them always and it seems like more and more just appears. It also includes the people in my receiving the same credit cards in the mail too. Which is done through the use of outside sources giving away your information for profit.

I don’t necessarily think the internet would be more useful without the methods I think the way they are done should be removed. Like the selling of people information and having them receive mail and calls for things they didn’t small up for. The selling of their information that allows certain advertisements that will be subject to them and easily convince them to do things without really thinking and reading up on them. There should honestly be some type of regulation for those type of things I don’t see why not, but they make it seem like they do that through terms and regulations which nobody reads all of that stuff and they know people don’t. People could be agreeing to give their information up without knowing or their rights could be violated without them even knowing.
