## *Contemporay Tools*

By Jamaica Spencer

In Chris Salters “Entangled” he discusses the Gesamtkunstwerk, is the idea of bringing all forms of art together and presenting them in a theatrical sense, which was the 
contemporary tool during that period. Gesamtkunstwerk is supposed to get rid of each art forms individual meaning or significance and fuse them together. The concept is 
to create an alternate realm in the art world, one that focuses on the audience’s sense and emotions through media elements. Intellect, Social and politically issues have
no place in a world like this because it doesn’t contribute to the audience.

In the modern-day theatrical practices is no longer the main source of technology and entertainment. We now live in a virtual world. Where is everything, we find to be 
entertaining is mostly online, through consoles and on the big screen. I think a contemporary tool that demonstrates Gesamtkunstwerk is Virtual Reality, a place where you can 
create whatever you like for yourself or others, there are no limitations. A tool that can accomplish that is the Oculus Quest. A portable headset and with wireless controllers 
for easy movement, that transports you to anywhere you desire. Compared to gaming consoles the audience also become the performer. The player can view live concerts, explore 
different parts of the world, and video games. For example, the game Beat Saber one I often play myself. It transports you into a geometric shaped based world with bright lights, 
music of you choosing and objects hurdling towards you, the player holds two sabers used to destroy the objects flying towards you based on the beat of the music you picked while 
also having to dodge transparent walls. You’re the audience in the sense you must listen to this music and watch the scenario play out but, also the performer because you must 
interact with it to keep the music and scene going. Based on the game itself, the oculus would be a great tool that demonstrates Gesamtkunstwerk and can demonstrate it in other 
ways.

BODIES INCORPORATED IN 1996, which also another virtual reality program could be considered a Gesamtkunstwerk because of the combination of literature, performance, and design. 
The audience is to create their own avatars through various body forms such as genders, sizes, ages, and textures. Based on the image’s players are also able to actively play in 
a virtual world. It’s also the same as the oculus in the aspect of the audience also becoming the performer. A version of virtual reality that we still use today in online gaming 
and consoles just improved as technology did.
