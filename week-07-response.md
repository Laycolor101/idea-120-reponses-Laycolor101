# Something is Wrong on the Internet

Bridle brings up the problem that new social media specifically YouTube is catering towards misleading children and scaring them.
Children are easily impressionable and the things they see on YouTube that supposed to kids friendly really aren’t. A lot of these
 content creators upload twisted and disturbing videos that children watch without really knowing what they are. She addresses many problems with this but doesn’t offer much of a solution, but not knowing how to respond to these problems without shutting down the system that resemble it.
I do agree with Bridle when she says, “Someone or something or some combination of people and things is using YouTube to
systematically frighten, traumatize, and abuse children, automatically and at scale.” I have seen this personally myself when
there was this weird cartoon thing by the name of Momo was telling children to go in the kitchen and get knives and other dangerous things. So, when she mentioned “Disturbing Peppa Pig videos, which tend towards extreme violence and fear, with Peppa eating her father or drinking bleach, are, it turns out very widespread.” I wasn’t surprised by this at all I’ve also seen cartoons of kids getting caught in the escalator. To be honest I don’t understand how YouTube lets these types of things get uploaded without review especially when their main audience is targeted towards children. These channels can do this and
draw in the attention of children using nursery rhymes and cartoons, things that take their attention for long periods of time.
 An example of this would be Peppa Pig with over 10 million search results a common theme that many channels use. You also must
 blame YouTube and not just the creators because they’re supposed to review videos that’s getting uploaded. I’ve seen YouTube
videos demonetized for literally nothing, something simple like a work. I also agree with the use of bots to boost the videos so
they can appear easily when searched in recommended, the more notoriety it gets the more views, and it attracts new children as
well. I don’t agree with her about people acting out their video titles because I don’t see its being a problem other than the
video being what it says its going to be and not clickbait.
