I want each of my projects to be presented on their own pages that way I can showcase the importance of each add extras like music, videos and/or pictures. The projects are on different subjects so each theme of the pages will be different to complement the project themselves.


Project 1 is a poem based on how troubling is to be scammed through the occurrence of various false emails which people commonly fall for.

*Black and white themed.
*Photos of scammer emails and warning signs
*Sound recording of video being read by me.

Project 2 is about what it’s like to live like an ant and what they experience.
