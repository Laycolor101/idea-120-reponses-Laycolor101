I want each of my projects to be presented on their own pages that way I can showcase the importance of each add extras like music, videos and/or pictures. The projects are on different subjects so each theme of the pages will be different to complement the project themselves.


Project 1 is a poem based on how troubling is to be scammed through the occurrence of various false emails which people commonly fall for.
