# *Jaguar Girl*

## By Jamaica Spencer

My twine game is about how a average high school girl by the name of Kalanie Murphy got her super powers and became
Jaguar Girl. This is no typical superhero she is accompanied by a spirit guide by the name of Robyn Lyn previously
known a Jaguar Girl. She has passed on her memories, skills, important information and often talks to Kalanie Murphy.
Kalanie must learn how to adjust to her new powers while also trying to grasp and understand what Robyn Lyn projects
onto her. Kalanie deals with frequent yet not clear flashbacks, acquiring new skills such as super speed, strength,
eyesight, and a hunter side. Will she handle the pressure or pass her new identity onto someone else? Is the world
really ready for a new Jaguar Girl!?
