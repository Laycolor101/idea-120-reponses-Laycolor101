# Interactive media

## Jamaica Spencer


When Lev Manovich saying "interactive media ask us to identify with someone else’s mental structure" he’s telling us that they give us the illusion that we have a
choice in what we’re seeing and get to explore but were following a guideline. Where being allowed to see and interactive with what the creator wants us to. Those
things are based on their own likes, dislikes, hobbies, and skills. We are merely participants in someone else’s world, and we are being active in their realm of
mind. When he mentions “Thus, just as visual culture studies are bringing its concerns regarding globalization, postcolonial imaging practices, identity formation,
gender, and different modes of possessing the gaze to bear on new media” these are topics that make up what’s trending in interactive media today, the creators
bring these topics to interactive media based on their viewpoints and we perceive them then bring them into the real world through sharing of communication and
activities. They have a lot more influence than just transporting use into their own “mental trajectory” it becomes our reality and effects our everyday lives.

An example of this concept would be Instagram which I often find myself using multiple times a day. The being of Instagram was about communicating, sharing, and
exploring the creative side of people. A view into the creator’s mind that they wanted to create a platform where people could be themselves, meet new people and
explore themselves and other creatively. But now it turned to an app based on shopping, selling viewers things, constant viewing of ig models and a luxury
lifestyle. All concepts of money making and profit through various updates such as now being able shop on the app changing out explosive the person can be.
There’s a constant bombard of trying to sell you something through add and random things on the explore page that have nothing to do with your interest as it
did before. Instagram is now a platform about making profit and no longer exploration.
